# C Programming Project
### About
C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories. It was primarily developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system. Despite being an older language, C remains highly popular due to its simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency.

Learning C provides a strong foundation for understanding other programming languages and computer science concepts. Many modern languages borrow syntax and features from C, making it easier to learn them if you have a background in C. Additionally, C helps in understanding the underlying architecture of operating systems, such as memory management and pointers.
